# Delta Sharing Project Overview

## Project Description
Delta Sharing is an open protocol for secure real-time exchange of large datasets. It enables organizations to share data in real time regardless of which computing platforms they use. The protocol is designed to be simple and secure, utilizing REST APIs and modern cloud storage systems (S3, ADLS, GCS) for reliable data transfer.

## Key Components

1. **Protocol Specification**
   - REST-based protocol for secure data sharing
   - Supports modern cloud storage systems
   - Detailed in PROTOCOL.md

2. **Python Connector**
   - Python library implementing Delta Sharing Protocol
   - Supports pandas DataFrame integration
   - Compatible with Apache Spark DataFrames
   - Requires Python 3.8+ (for version 1.1+)

3. **Apache Spark Connector**
   - Implements Delta Sharing Protocol for Spark
   - Supports multiple programming languages (SQL, Python, Java, Scala, R)
   - Enables direct table access from Delta Sharing Server

4. **Delta Sharing Server**
   - Reference implementation for development
   - Supports sharing existing tables in Delta Lake
   - Compatible with Apache Parquet format
   - Cloud storage system integration

## Main Functionalities

1. **Data Sharing**
   - Secure real-time data exchange
   - Platform-agnostic sharing capabilities
   - Support for large datasets
   - Cloud storage system integration

2. **Data Access**
   - Direct connection through various tools (pandas, Tableau, Apache Spark, Rust)
   - No specific compute platform requirement
   - Profile-based authentication
   - Support for partial dataset access

3. **Integration Capabilities**
   - Multiple programming language support
   - Various data format compatibility
   - Cloud storage system flexibility
   - Cross-platform functionality

## Setup Instructions

1. **Python Connector Installation**
   ```bash
   pip3 install delta-sharing
   ```

2. **System Requirements**
   - Python 3.8+ for version 1.1+
   - For Linux: glibc version >= 2.31
   - Rust installation may be required for some environments

3. **Getting Started**
   - Download or create a profile file
   - Initialize SharingClient with profile
   - Access shared tables through provided APIs
   - Use pandas or Spark DataFrames for data manipulation

## Best Practices
- Always use secure profile file management
- Monitor data access patterns
- Implement proper authentication mechanisms
- Follow the protocol specifications for compatibility
- Keep connectors and dependencies updated

This project enables seamless data sharing across different platforms while maintaining security and efficiency in data transfer operations.
